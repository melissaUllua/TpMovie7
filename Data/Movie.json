That is why Sinterklaas and the Pieten are forced to stay at a campsite. Even Hugo Hogepief is at a loss, because no castle means no presents and gingerbread cookies for the children. Even though Kim Kado, Marco Marsepein and Willem Wortel try their utmost, there is a huge chance that the Sinterklaas party will not happen.

His real ambition is to be a movie star, and this comes a step closer when he meets an Australian photographer. But in a city where every family has a member who has been \u201cmartyred,\u201d the streets are as perilous as they are vivid. Australia\u2019s recent involvement with Afghanistan has been mixed, to say the best. The deeply-felt humanism of this film might just be our most effective contribution to that troubled country.",

The result is \u2018No Heroes\u2019, which is mainly an observation exercise on the dynamic relationship of space, body and technology, in wheelchair basketball. As wheelchair sports in Greece do not enjoy great publicity, the documentary focuses on the basic level of assemblage, hoping that observation will turn to viewpoint on the big screen.",

In this documentary, his relationship with the paranormal, luck and fate, alongside the coexistence of organized discourse and transcendence to the imaginary, is examined via friends, collaborators and distinguished fans (Friedkin, Gilliam, Chazelle). A great testimony to why rationalists and ideologists have a hard time with his work, \u2018Fellini and the Spirits\u2019 is an appropriate yet unexpected tribute.",

Hurtado\u2019s images are saturated, grainy, willingly experimental and clash with those of an archive of furious performances. Just like the one who seeks to avoid taking part in her own prophecy.",

He photographed the Six-Day War, the events of May 1968 in Paris, the Northern Ireland conflict, and the Vietnam War. In Looking for Gilles Caron, director Mariana Otero delves deeply into Caron's body of work, which includes 100 thousand photos, and uses the images that emerge \u2013 as well as the lulls between each shot \u2013 to analyze, interpret, and formulate the story of this mysterious photographer, who, in a short period of time, surveyed numerous significant events leaving behind a tremendous artistic imprint.",

Fram is a documentary and travel film about two friends journeying to the end of the earth, in order to make a dance film in the arctic wilderness of Svalbard. En route, they explore the history of our ideas of the Arctic, along with the grand questions of life, art and our place in the world. Sharing their love of discovering new geographic and artistic frontiers, choreographer-dancer-filmmakers and outdoor enthusiasts Thomas Freundlich and Valtteri Raekallio take the viewer on an engaging journey to a place where few have been and even fewer have danced.",

It would take them 15 minutes to reach the bottom, but 12 hours to surface. Once he touched bottom, against all odds, Dave finds a body.  The two friends decide to come back and retrieve it. They call the parents, enroll 8 support divers, and hire a cameraman to document the historic dive in its entirety \u2013 from the preparation on the surface to the operation at the bottom of the cave.  Little did they know that, from that dive, Dave would not be coming back.  In a time of over-performance driven by self-promotion and self-filming, Dave Not Coming Back is a story of loss and mourning where ego and altruism, hubris and self-control, risk-taking and spirituality all go hand in hand. A chain of paradoxical choices that lead to a tragedy long foreseen, yet impossible to prevent.",

From the up-and-coming independent curator to the global powerhouse, these creatives have crafted a brand for themselves as industry leaders, without compromising who they are. They are paving the way for a generation of women and LGBTQ people, previously excluded from the social and cultural norms of the hip-hop world. It is the weirdos and nonconformists who are now redefining what it means to be a woman of colour in hip-hop. \"Badassery\" examines the social, political and cultural factors that enabled and empowered their success, such as the growing economization of social media, the rise of independent artists, and beauty as capital.",

After a decade of absence and after the band continued its musical creation without him, Lulai returns to Rockfour, causing great excitement amongst Rockfour fans.

Once in Darjeeling he built a Monastery at 54 Gandhi Road. It was here where the few single-minded Westerners in search of a more meaningful life, began to arrive in the late 1960\u2019s.  Told through the eyes of one of those first Westerners, New Zealander Kim Hegan, as he now, more than 40 years after Rinpoche\u2019s passing, and his Buddhist practice abandoned, will trace the journey he made to Darjeeling 45 years earlier, to tell Rinpoche\u2019s profound story, while healing the trauma that kept him away for so long.",
